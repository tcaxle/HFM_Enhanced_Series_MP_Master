The HFM Enhanced Series
#######################

This mod is built on HFM V1.27I and HFM More Stuff V3.5 submod. Below are my changes.
Infamy reduction depending on rank & healthcare changes inspired by Heirs to Aquitania, population size effects and LGLC tax moddifiers inspired by PDM Divide by Zero.
Population growth decision and conditions UI changes taken from The Grand Combo.
Thanks to Nurse_Reno for the craftsmen fix.
General UI change taken from Victoria Universalis. Everything else is my own (as far as I remember).
Note that 'global' on a modifier means just across your country.

-- Once the US has manifest destiny, can claim all of Mexico for 32 infamy, throwing the US straight into an annex war on mexico (doesnt get cores any more than the usual manifest destiny ones)
* Russia
-- Russia no longer starts with accepted cultures Ukrainian and Belarusian
-- Can get them accepted via decision around 1870 via researching specific culture techs Social Science & Experimental Pshychology

* Spain

-- carbon_soil in organic_chemistry gives +25% throughput
-- mines and fields shiftwork in shift_work tech gives another +25% throughput

* Added modifiers of +0.4 +0.3, +0.2  to base emmigration rate in years 1848, 1871 and 1900
* Switzerland if a republic has a reduced emigration rate like republics in the new world
(I dont think I changed anything else, but the effect on gov type and whether you are meeting your citizens reform desires makes a far bigger impact on their emmigration rate than before. Republics are very good at getting immigrants and keeping them, but con. monarchies are pretty good as well.)
* US homestead act and statue of liberty immigration modifiers increased moderately to partially account for increase immigration attraction from reforms

-- Can remove this effect if no longer fascist via another decision

Factory Upgrade Changes
* Factories that took 2 years to build now take 200 days
* Factories that took 1 year to build now take 100 days

Population Size effects

* Check triggerd_modifiers file in common to see all at the different pop sizes
* Pops start dying below 70% life needs met

GFX & Localisation Changes
* USA flag shanged to fallout one so stars make sense when adding more states
* Ottoman Republic (Turkey) renamed to Sublime Porte, flag changed (like DOD)
* General's attack and defence stats are now visible at a glance (without needing to hover)

Federal Republic of Great Britain - Easter Egg
* Spawned via decision when playing as the UK - availbale until 1851 
* Can easily get cores on whole british isles, with all cultures there accepted after fighting a civil war with the UK
* Massively increased RGO size, factory and research output and slightly increased pop growth at the cost of not being able to manufacture CBs, ticking reduction of prestige, halved diplo point gain, and no influence with other nations
* Can get immigration like the new world, and decision to give it almost the same attraction and assimilation as the USA can get
* Unique party: The Federalists (liberal)
* National value: Equality
* INCREDIBLY STRONG nation at home (~Greater Germany power levels), but isolationist
