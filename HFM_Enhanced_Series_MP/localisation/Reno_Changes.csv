craftsmen_fix_desc;This decision launches 3 events one after another that converts all non-core / non-accepted craftsmen that are on your cores ONLY into farmers. The second event will convert all 100% unemployed farmers into labourers (bypasses a glitch due to the limited power of pop configuring). The third will convert all 100% labourers into artisans (incase farming rgos were full and now labourers in a province with no labourer employment).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
